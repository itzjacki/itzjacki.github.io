        <h1>Afterglow</h1>
        <h3>A project about striving to cause as many rhythm game addictions as humanly possible</h3>
        
        <p>
            Afterglow is <i>first an foremost</i> a java project, let me make that very clear. The entire reason 
            I made this was for an assignment at university, where we were tasked with creating a game of our choosing.
            To practice timed events and animation i decided to make a rhythm game, and to go with it, I chose my favorite
            super-high-energy tune, Brain Power by Noma. I did try and contact him before uploading the game here, but he
            wouldn't respond :(. The reason I wanted to upload the game is so first of all, I can show off how bad my code is, 
            and secondly, so I can let other people actually play the game, and see how they do. I have also uploaded the source
            code, so that anyone can take a look at how I wrote it all. Enjoy!
        </p>
